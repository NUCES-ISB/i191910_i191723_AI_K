### We used the above mentioned github repository. 2 branches were created. One Branch included python libraries “Black” and “Autoflake”. Black checks the formatting of the code, such as indents,spaces and empty lines. Autoflake removes unused variables from the code. The second Branch uses “Isort” and “Pylint” libraries. Isort sorts the libraries being used in the code and Pylint scores the overall qaulity of the code out of ten. Now whenever a “Push” action happens, the above mentioned workflows will be executed.
